This is a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

In this task, I created a TO DO list using webpack. 

When starting this project, I thought it would be very easy. It's very basic, it seems. But going through it, it was harder than I anticipated. 

I learned a lot about breaking up code into modules and tried to keep with writing clean, maintainable code.
