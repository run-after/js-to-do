/*
  Add ability to delete tasks - started. Marked new button with '/////'
  added removeTask.js - now just need logic

  Make priority already selected on task

  Add ability to edit tasks

  Style and label the inputs on task

  The description could be long. If so, it makes that
  task box large and shrings the others. Maybe hide the 
  description unless clicked on, then expand it with a 
  close button that would shrink it again

  Add local storage
