/*
  Move DOM logic out of addProject and into addProjectToDOM

  Add ability to edit tasks

  Style and label the inputs on task

  The description could be long. If so, it makes that
  task box large and shrings the others. Maybe hide the 
  description unless clicked on, then expand it with a 
  close button that would shrink it again

  Add local storage
